---

**SMART Lab** is an independent cognitive science laboratory focused on understanding how humans mentally represent and interact with quantities such as numbers, time, and size along spatial dimensions.

Our research explores the cognitive and neural mechanisms behind space-magnitude associations, including how numerical information is mapped onto spatial representations and how these mappings influence behavior, perception, and decision-making.

### 🧠 Core Research Areas

- Spatial-Numerical Associations (e.g., the SNARC effect)
- Mental Number Line and numerical spatial representation
- Stimulus-response compatibility and cognitive control
- Attention, working memory, and their interaction with magnitude processing
- Embodied and cultural factors in spatial-magnitude mapping

We aim to contribute to open, reproducible, and collaborative science through empirical research, software development, and academic dissemination.
